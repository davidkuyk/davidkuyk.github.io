    <h2>Web Developer</h2>
    <p class="main-description">I am an enthusiastic web developer who would love to help build or improve your website. My background as a small-business owner for 5 years provides me with a unique skill-set covering everything from online marketing and UI/UX design to customer service and human resources. When I'm not obsessing over a project, I am painting, reading, or enjoying a good, old-fashioned walk. I look forward to helping your company provide your users with a simple, exceptional experience.</p>

        <h3>Apton Biosystems</h3>
        <p>I converted XD designs into a functioning website for this biosystems company, including video backgrounds on the homepage, entrance animations, and other custom CSS work. I also did quite a bit of back-end work troubleshooting DNS records to point their domain from their old site to the new site.</p>
