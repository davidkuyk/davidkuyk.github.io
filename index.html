        <h2>Hello. This is my programming portfolio.</h2>
        <p>I am looking for a remote full-time or part-time position with a company operating at the intersection between education and technology. My background as a small-business owner for 5 years provides me with a unique skill-set covering everything from online marketing and UI/UX design to customer service and human resources. I look forward to helping a company provide their users with an exceptional educational experience.</p>
